# CPP-Keyword-Analyzer
Picsart Labs Project

Write a program that analyzes the C++ file and prints the number of
keywords (use the following list C++ keywords - cppreference.com ),
functions, variables and
classes in it.
For functions the program should also print how many arguments each
function takes.

To execute a program, just run:
    make; ./analyzer.exe [input_file_name]

NOTE:
    [input_file_name] file should be in a data/ directory
